## Speed Control

Involves design of mechanisms to allow for control of the speed of the motor.
Schematics and final designs handled here.

## Design
In this implementation we will control the brushless motor using Arduino and ESC.

## Components

Brushless Motor <br>
ESC 30A <br>
Li-Po battery <br>
Arduino Board <br>
Potentiometer <br>
Breadboard and Jump Wires<br>

# Alternative solution
This involves the use of a ready made Handlebar Throttle Switch to allow for the control of speed.

## Reasons for choosing this solution
Pairs well with the motor controller being used.( A plug and play solution). <br>
Has inbuilt LED speed display eliminating the need of an external LCD display. <br>
Does not involve the use of a microcontroller thus saving costs.
